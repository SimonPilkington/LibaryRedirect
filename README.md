# LibaryRedirect
Like not having your Windows libraries on your system drive? Great. Use this so you don't have to move them manually.

# Usage

```
LibraryRedirect.exe [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -h,--help                   Print this help message and exit
  --documents PATH            Set Documents path to PATH
  --downloads PATH            Set Downloads path to PATH
  --desktop PATH              Set Desktop path to PATH
```

All options (except -h) can be used at once, but try not to set two different libraries to the same path. The system won't like that, and I'm too lazy to provide a way to reset it.
